This proof-of-concept study presents the development and validation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to automatically detect and classify endometrial polyps. <b>Methods</b>: A multicenter dataset (n = 3) comprising 65 hysteroscopies was used, yielding 33,239 frames and 37,512 annotated objects. Still frames were extracted from full-length videos and annotated for the presence of histologically confirmed polyps. A YOLOv1-based object detection model was used with a 70-20-10 split for training, validation, and testing. Primary performance metrics included recall, precision, and mean average precision'"

      "\n",
      "The development of bi-specific antibody treatments is an approach aimed at improving cancer immunotherapies, where many current treatment forms only target one tumor-specific antigen. This approach has yielded some success, but addressing a single tumor-specific protein antigen is often not enough to effectively kill all the tumor cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a highly effective treatment for multiple malignancies. However, one limitation is tumor antigen-heterogeneity and downregulation, which allows tumor cells to evade conventional, monospecific CAR T cells,” the researchers wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeting two or more cell surface antigens to address multiple drivers of cancer growth, bi-specific CAR T cells represent a logical next step in tackling tumor heterogeneity. But designing effective bi-specifics has been a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, the St. Jude team developed a computational approach that allows them to screen a large number of theoretical bi-specific CAR designs and rank them to identify a small handful with the most promise for optimization and validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, the team initially designed a bi-specific tandem CAR targeting the IL13Rα2 and B7-H3 antigens, which are often present in pediatric brain tumors. Unfortunately, their original construct failed to express on the T cell surface. But this failure led to a breakthrough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We describe how our originally designed constructs failed to express due to a ‘trouble region’ within the VH (variable heavy) of the IL13Rα2  scFv (single-chain variable fragment),” the researchers wrote. Through systematic testing of 24 tandem constructs and super-resolution microscopy, the researchers found that misfolding and intracellular accumulation was the likely causes of this design’s expression failure.\n",

      "The team then turned to the protein design software AbLIFT to computationally modify the structure of the CAR’s variable regions, which addressed this misfolding to create greater cell surface expression.

      "A computational approach by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital scientists promises to make designing T cell-based immunotherapies that target two cancer-related antigens at the same time far easier and faster. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a type of immunotherapy that reprograms a patient’s immune cells to target a tumor-specific protein antigen. Targeting just one cell surface antigen often is not enough to eradicate the tumor. Thus, scientists have tried to create CARs that target two proteins at once. However, they have encountered problems, including poor CAR expression on the surface of T cells and suboptimal cancer-killing ability. To address this, St. Jude researchers developed a computational method to screen many theoretical tandem CAR designs and ranked the top candidates for further optimization and validation. The researchers experimentally generated and validated the top-ranked tandem CAR candidates against their chosen targets, demonstrating that the computationally optimized CARs overcame the prior challenges and function better in treating animal models of cancer. The findings were published today in *Molecular Therapy*.\n",

      "\n",
      "While CAR T cells have successfully treated some blood cancers, they have not been as effective in treating solid and brain tumors. One reason is that cancer cells do not uniformly express the same proteins, so CAR T cells targeting a single antigen can miss malignant cells that do not express that protein, leaving them to regrow the tumor and cause a difficult-to-treat relapse. A tandem bi-specific CAR that targets two cancer-related proteins may prevent the original tumor from escaping the treatment, though optimizing their design has been a time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive challenge in the field.\n",

      "The computational pipeline predicted a better design for a tandem CAR that targeted the pediatric-brain tumor-related proteins B7-H3 and IL-13Rα2. The original unoptimized version of the bi-specific tandem CAR failed to reach the surface of the T cell, preventing it from contacting its target protein on tumor cells to perform its cancer-killing function. After confirming that the computationally optimized CAR expressed on the T cell surface, the researchers tested it against several single-targeted CARs in mice with tumors that had a mix of cells with both targets, one target or the other, or neither target, mimicking heterogeneous tumors observed in the clinic.\n",

      "### Effective Tumor Clearance in Preclinical Models\n",
      "\n",
      "The study focused on pediatric brain tumor antigens B7-H3 and IL-13Rα2. The original bi-specific CAR failed to express on the T cell surface, limiting its function. After computational optimization, the tandem CAR was expressed effectively and tested in mice bearing tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results showed complete tumor clearance in four out of five mice treated with the optimized tandem CAR T cells. In contrast, tumors treated with single-target CAR T cells regrew. Additional testing confirmed that the computational method enhanced the efficacy of other tandem CAR designs as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "### A Generalizable Tool for CAR Development\n",
      "\n",
      "This computational approach can screen approximately 1,000 CAR constructs in days, significantly reducing the development timeline compared to traditional laboratory methods. By integrating structural biology and data science, the tool supports rapid iteration and optimization of CAR designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers emphasize that this method is broadly applicable across CAR constructs targeting various cancer antigens. It offers a practical pathway to improve immunotherapies for difficult-to-treat tumors, such as those found in pediatric brain cancers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T–cell therapy redirects a patient’s own immune cells to target a cancer-specific protein. Optimizing CAR T–cell therapy for different pediatric cancers requires improved understanding of T–cell biology and immune processes. One challenge in the field has been identifying tumor-specific targets that are both uniformly expressed and not essential in healthy tissues. St. Jude scientists are addressing this issue by designing and developing CARs with more sophisticated targeting ability. The work provides foundational understanding that may guide future CAR T–cell design across cancer types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study, published in *Cell Reports Medicine*, showed how a computational approach incorporating AlphaFold2, an AI-powered protein folding prediction tool, could shed light on how structure impacts CAR T–cell function in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Combining this improved CAR design with computational prediction could potentially expand treatment options for AML and other malignancies traditionally resistant to current therapies.\n",

      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy demonstrates substantial efficacy in various hematological malignancies. However, its application in solid tumors is still limited. Clinical studies report suboptimal outcomes such as reduced cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells and tumor evasion, underscoring the need to address the challenges of sliding cytotoxicity in CAR-T cells. Despite improvements from fourth and next-generation CAR-T cells, new challenges include systemic toxicity from continuously secreted proteins, low productivity, and elevated costs. Recent research targets genetic modifications to boost killing potential, metabolic interventions to hinder tumor progression, and diverse combination strategies to enhance CAR-T cell therapy. Efforts to reduce the duration and cost of CAR-T cell therapy include developing allogenic and in-vivo approaches, promising significant future advancements. Concurrently, innovative technologies and platforms enhance the potential of CAR-T cell therapy to overcome limitations in treating solid tumors. This review explores strategies to optimize CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, focusing on enhancing cytotoxicity and overcoming application restrictions. We summarize recent advances in T cell subset selection, CAR-T structural modifications, infiltration enhancement, genetic and metabolic interventions, production optimization, and the integration of novel technologies, presenting therapeutic approaches that could improve CAR-T cell therapy’s efficacy and applicability in solid tumors.\n",

      "As the latest and most anticipated method of tumor immunotherapy, CAR-NK therapy has received increasing attention in recent years, and its safety and high efficiency have irreplaceable advantages over CAR-T. Current research focuses on the application of CAR-NK in hematological tumors, while there are fewer studies on solid tumor. This article reviews the process of constructing CAR-NK, the effects of hypoxia and metabolic factors, NK cell surface receptors, cytokines, and exosomes on the efficacy of CAR-NK in solid tumor, and the role of CAR-NK in various solid tumor. The mechanism of action and the research status of the potential of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor in clinical practice, and put forward the advantages, limitations and future problems of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor.\n",

      "\n",
      "Due to the recent proposal of CAR-NK therapy, there are currently very few CAR end designs available for reference, especially for solid tumors. It is unclear whether there is a universal design that is effective for all solid tumors or whether there is a specific optimal solution design for each solid tumor. Moreover, the current experimental sample size is generally too small and lacks integration. We need a large number of basic and clinical trials to verify and compare the effects of various CARs. Further validation is needed to determine whether CAR-NK can be widely applied in the treatment of solid tumors in clinical practice in the future.\n",

      "Under normal circumstances, the immune system can identify and eliminate tumor cells within the Tumor microenvironment (TME). However, to survive and grow, tumor cells employ diverse strategies to suppress the immune system, enabling their survival during different stages of the anti-tumor immune response. This phenomenon, where tumor cells exhibit the described characteristics, is termed ‘immune escape’ [[1](/articles/s41420-024-01815-9#ref-CR1 \"Vinay DS, Ryan EP, Pawelec G, Talib WH, Stagg J, Elkord E, et al.

      "\n",
      "Today, adoptive cell therapy has many successes in cancer therapy, and this subject is brilliant in using chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The CAR T cell therapy, with its FDA-approved drugs, could treat several types of hematological malignancies and thus be very attractive for treating solid cancer. Unfortunately, the CAR T cell cannot be very functional in solid cancers due to its unique features. This treatment method has several harmful adverse effects that limit their applications, so novel treatments must use new cells like NK cells, NKT cells, and macrophage cells. Among these cells, the CAR macrophage cells, due to their brilliant innate features, are more attractive for solid tumor therapy and seem to be a better candidate for the prior treatment methods. The CAR macrophage cells have vital roles in the tumor microenvironment and, with their direct effect, can eliminate tumor cells efficiently. In addition, the CAR macrophage cells, due to being a part of the innate immune system, attended the tumor sites. With the high infiltration, their therapy modulations are more effective. This review investigates the last achievements in CAR-macrophage cells and the future of this immunotherapy treatment method.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Immunotherapy has come to fruition in recent years for cancer treatment by manipulating the immune system. Among the various forms of immunotherapy, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a brilliant and efficient way due to the tread more personalized and targeted treatments [[1](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR1 \"Tahmasebi S, Elahi R, Esmaeilzadeh A. Solid Tumors challenges and new insights of CAR T cell engineering. Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2019;15(5):619–36.\")]. As a subset of ACT, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are frontier with distinctive outcomes in cancer therapy. Until now introduced, six FDA-approved drugs utilizing CAR T against hematological malignancies were introduced: Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus, Breyanzi, Abecma, and Carvykti [[2](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR2 \"Asmamaw Dejenie T, Tiruneh GMM, Dessie Terefe G, Tadele Admasu F, Wale Tesega W, Chekol AE. Current updates on generations, approvals, and clinical trials of CAR T-cell therapy. Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2022;18(6):2114254.\")].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, CAR-T cell therapy has several obstacles the high cost and time-consuming production, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), “on-target/off-tumor” toxicity, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) [[3](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR3 \"Bonifant CL, Jackson HJ, Brentjens RJ, Curran KJ.

CAR T cell therapy: newer approaches to counter resistance and cost. Heliyon. 2020;6(4):e03779.\")]. Indeed, the CAR T cell had less effectiveness in solid cancers due to special features like heterogeneity, antigen escaping, limited T cell fitness, inefficient homing and infiltration, and high complexity of tumor microenvironment (TME) [[5](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR5 \"Wagner J, Wickman E, DeRenzo C, Gottschalk S. CAR T Cell Therapy for solid tumors: bright future or dark reality? Molecular Therapy: J American Soc Gene Therapy. 2020;28(11):2320–39.\")]. TME has a crucial role in cancer progression and reduces the efficacy of the CAR T cells by several mechanisms such as physical barriers, rivalry for metabolic fuels, cell exhaustion, immunosuppressive microenvironment, and various immunosuppressive cells like T regulatory (Treg) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [[6](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR6 \"Kankeu Fonkoua LA, Sirpilla O, Sakemura R, Siegler EL, Kenderian SS.

      "The two projects described in this thesis sought to tackle two distinct aspects attributed to the general failure of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR Ts) against solid tumors. The first is the possibility of on-target off-tumor toxicity. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target based on its overexpression in a variety of cancers, but its presence on healthy tissue led to severe toxicities through clinical trials of anti-EGFR CAR T cells. Due to murine EGFR (mEGFR) sharing 88% amino acid sequence with human EGFR, we decided to generate a syngeneic mouse model to replicate and help predict toxicities seen clinically. To model potential effects of these CAR T toxicities, we have developed a system using both CAR T cells and tumors derived from syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Since all cells originate from the same genetic background, we can observe the effects of our anti-mEGFR CAR T cells under an intact immune system. These findings underscore the importance of our model predicting CAR T cell-mediated toxicities. Although still early, this system may be used as an effective model of other potential CAR T-cell toxicities against antigen targets that are comparable between human and mice.  \n",
      "The second project sought to resolve the problem of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) perpetrated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We developed a bicistronic lentiviral vector for a CAR T cell that additionally secretes a bispecfic T-cell engaging Antibody Molecule (TEAM) denoted as CAR-TEAM. This two-target approach seeks to eliminate the surrounding Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) that play a large role in immunosuppression of immune cells in clinical PDAC cases and increases the anti-tumor efficacy. Based on in vitro results, our CAR-TEAM system may be a clinically relevant immunotherapy for PDAC.\n",

      "Radiation therapy (RT) is the most used method for cancer treatment, which aims to deliver the prescribed dose to the planning target volumes (PTVs), while simultaneously reducing at minimum the dose to organs-at-risk (OARs) ([1](#B1)). Obtaining a clinically acceptable RT treatment plan often requires a long time, tedious work, and a high level of physician/technician experience ([2](#B2)).\n",
      "\n",
      "The general steps to perform RT planning include [computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/positron emission tomography (PET)] image acquisition, contouring of treatment area (gross tumor volume, OARs, etc.), treatment plan optimization, and treatment delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are still some challenges: first, sometimes a diagnosis is performed on magnetic resonance (MR) scans because of better soft-tissue contrast, but a CT is always required to make a plan. Second, contouring and treatment planning is time-consuming and dependent on expertise which is prone to inter-observer variability. Finally, in-room imaging is of a lower quality than diagnostic CT.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last 10 years, the RT research community has focused on optimizing and automizing the above-presented steps by using artificial intelligence (AI). With the development of computer science, deep learning (DL) algorithms, a branch of AI, are widely applied by researchers to solve the above-mentioned issues. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a subset of DL, became popular in the medical imaging domain, mainly for synthetic data generation ([2](#B2)). Since GAN was proposed in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow ([3](#B3)), it has been widely used by an increasing number of applications in standard of care medical imaging, especially in CT, MRI, and plays a great role in RT ([4](#B4)). A deep understanding of GANs requires specific knowledge of computer science, often not available at RT clinics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in this review, we will introduce the development of the GAN models, their structures, their improvements, and their applications in RT which can help the researchers have a preliminary knowledge about these DL models.\n",
      "\n",
      "For readers interested in a specific application of GANs, we have grouped the GAN applications into three clusters: CT translation and synthesis (see later GANs for synthetic imaging), dose and plan calculation (see later GANs for dose and plan calculation), and image quality improvement (see later GANs for quality improvement). Finally, we have discussed the limitations and future directions to give some hints for the following researchers who want to develop GAN applications in RT. We present the following article in accordance with the Narrative Review reporting checklist (available at <https://pcm.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/pcm-22-28/rc>).\n",
