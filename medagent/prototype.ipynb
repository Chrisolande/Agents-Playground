The main findings were themed around considerations and perspectives relating to AI education, impact on image quality and radiation dose, ethical and medico-legal implications for the use of AI, patient considerations and their perceived significance of AI for their care, and factors that influence development, implementation and job security. Despite varying emphasis, these themes collectively provide a global perspective on AI in medical imaging practice. While expertise levels are varied and different, both radiographers and radiologists were generally optimistic about incorporation of AI in medical imaging practice. However, low levels of AI education and knowledge remain a critical barrier. Furthermore, equipment errors, cost,\n",

However, clinical integration of AI is already well-underway. Many authors have recently reported on the AI knowledge and perceptions of radiologists/medical staff and students however there is a paucity of information regarding radiographers. Published literature agrees that AI is likely to have significant impact on radiology practice. As radiographers are at the forefront of radiology service delivery, an awareness of the current level of their perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI is essential to identify any educational needs necessary for successful adoption into practice. <b>Aim:</b> The aim of this survey was to determine\n",

The recent evolution of AI into approaches such as deep learning has dramatically accelerated the application of AI across a wide range of radiologic settings. Despite the promises of AI, developers and users of AI technology must be fully aware of its potential biases and pitfalls, and this knowledge must be incorporated throughout the AI system development pipeline that involves training, validation, and testing. Grand challenges offer an opportunity to advance the development of AI methods for targeted applications and provide a mechanism for both directing and facilitating the development of AI systems.

      "A research team at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has leveraged AI to use a computational approach to design more effective bi-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The method, [detailed in the journal *Molecular Therapy*](https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(25)00580-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001625005805%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), promises to overcome challenges that plague the effectiveness of bi-specific CAR Ts including poor CAR expression on the surface of [CAR T](https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/?s=CAR+T) cells and suboptimal cancer-killing properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have developed and validated a computational tool that can significantly accelerate the design of tandem CAR constructs with improved surface expression and anti-tumor function,” said senior author Giedre Krenciute, PhD, a member of the department of bone marrow transplantation and cellular therapy (BMTCT) at St. Jude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of bi-specific antibody treatments is an approach aimed at improving cancer immunotherapies, where many current treatment forms only target one tumor-specific antigen. This approach has yielded some success, but addressing a single tumor-specific protein antigen is often not enough to effectively kill all the tumor cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a highly effective treatment for multiple malignancies. However, one limitation is tumor antigen-heterogeneity and downregulation, which allows tumor cells to evade conventional, monospecific CAR T cells,” the researchers wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeting two or more cell surface antigens to address multiple drivers of cancer growth, bi-specific CAR T cells represent a logical next step in tackling tumor heterogeneity. But designing effective bi-specifics has been a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, the St. Jude team developed a computational approach that allows them to screen a large number of theoretical bi-specific CAR designs and rank them to identify a small handful with the most promise for optimization and validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, the team initially designed a bi-specific tandem CAR targeting the IL13Rα2 and B7-H3 antigens, which are often present in pediatric brain tumors. Unfortunately, their original construct failed to express on the T cell surface. But this failure led to a breakthrough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We describe how our originally designed constructs failed to express due to a ‘trouble region’ within the VH (variable heavy) of the IL13Rα2  scFv (single-chain variable fragment),” the researchers wrote. Through systematic testing of 24 tandem constructs and super-resolution microscopy, the researchers found that misfolding and intracellular accumulation was the likely causes of this design’s expression failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team then turned to the protein design software AbLIFT to computationally modify the structure of the CAR’s variable regions, which addressed this misfolding to create greater cell surface expression. These optimized tandem CARs were then validated *in vitro* and *in vivo*, outperforming single-target CAR Ts.\n",

      "A computational approach by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital scientists promises to make designing T cell-based immunotherapies that target two cancer-related antigens at the same time far easier and faster. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a type of immunotherapy that reprograms a patient’s immune cells to target a tumor-specific protein antigen. Targeting just one cell surface antigen often is not enough to eradicate the tumor. Thus, scientists have tried to create CARs that target two proteins at once. However, they have encountered problems, including poor CAR expression on the surface of T cells and suboptimal cancer-killing ability. To address this, St. Jude researchers developed a computational method to screen many theoretical tandem CAR designs and ranked the top candidates for further optimization and validation. The researchers experimentally generated and validated the top-ranked tandem CAR candidates against their chosen targets, demonstrating that the computationally optimized CARs overcame the prior challenges and function better in treating animal models of cancer. The findings were published today in *Molecular Therapy*.\n",

A tandem bi-specific CAR that targets two cancer-related proteins may prevent the original tumor from escaping the treatment, though optimizing their design has been a time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive challenge in the field.\n",

      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy demonstrates substantial efficacy in various hematological malignancies. However, its application in solid tumors is still limited. Clinical studies report suboptimal outcomes such as reduced cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells and tumor evasion, underscoring the need to address the challenges of sliding cytotoxicity in CAR-T cells. Despite improvements from fourth and next-generation CAR-T cells, new challenges include systemic toxicity from continuously secreted proteins, low productivity, and elevated costs. Recent research targets genetic modifications to boost killing potential, metabolic interventions to hinder tumor progression, and diverse combination strategies to enhance CAR-T cell therapy. Efforts to reduce the duration and cost of CAR-T cell therapy include developing allogenic and in-vivo approaches, promising significant future advancements. Concurrently, innovative technologies and platforms enhance the potential of CAR-T cell therapy to overcome limitations in treating solid tumors. This review explores strategies to optimize CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, focusing on enhancing cytotoxicity and overcoming application restrictions. We summarize recent advances in T cell subset selection, CAR-T structural modifications, infiltration enhancement, genetic and metabolic interventions, production optimization, and the integration of novel technologies, presenting therapeutic approaches that could improve CAR-T cell therapy’s efficacy and applicability in solid tumors.\n",

Although the FDA has approved CAR-T cell therapies for certain hematological malignancies, a significant proportion of patients relapse within one year after infusion [[3](/articles/10.1186/s13045-024-01625-7#ref-CR3 \"Liu Z, Lei W, Wang H, Liu X, Fu R.

Nevertheless, the majority of patients, particularly those with solid tumors, continue to exhibit resistance to CAR-T cell therapy. Several challenges persist in treating solid tumors with CAR-T cells, including insufficient cytotoxicity, poor infiltration, tumor microenvironment suppression, high costs, and safety concerns [[6](/articles/10.1186/s13045-024-01625-7#ref-CR6 \"Zeng W, Zhang P.

      "Most relevant content: In this work, we develop a simplified spatiotemporal model for CAR T-cell treatment of solid tumors, and use numerical simulations to compare the effect of introducing CAR T cells via intratumoral injection versus intracavitary administration in diverse cancer types. We demonstrate that the model can reproduce tumor and CAR T-cell data from small imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models. To account for spatial variation in cell concentration and provide insight into how the geometry of the delivery of CAR T cells impacts treatment efficacy, we employ a 3-D reaction-diffusion modeling framework for local administration of CAR T cells to treat solid tumors. In this article, we develop a 3-dimensional spatio-temporal model for CAR T-cell therapies applied to dynamic solid tumors.\n",

      "As the latest and most anticipated method of tumor immunotherapy, CAR-NK therapy has received increasing attention in recent years, and its safety and high efficiency have irreplaceable advantages over CAR-T. Current research focuses on the application of CAR-NK in hematological tumors, while there are fewer studies on solid tumor. This article reviews the process of constructing CAR-NK, the effects of hypoxia and metabolic factors, NK cell surface receptors, cytokines, and exosomes on the efficacy of CAR-NK in solid tumor, and the role of CAR-NK in various solid tumor. The mechanism of action and the research status of the potential of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor in clinical practice, and put forward the advantages, limitations and future problems of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor.\n",

      "## Open questions\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the recent proposal of CAR-NK therapy, there are currently very few CAR end designs available for reference, especially for solid tumors. It is unclear whether there is a universal design that is effective for all solid tumors or whether there is a specific optimal solution design for each solid tumor. Moreover, the current experimental sample size is generally too small and lacks integration. We need a large number of basic and clinical trials to verify and compare the effects of various CARs. Further validation is needed to determine whether CAR-NK can be widely applied in the treatment of solid tumors in clinical practice in the future.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Under normal circumstances, the immune system can identify and eliminate tumor cells within the Tumor microenvironment (TME). However, to survive and grow, tumor cells employ diverse strategies to suppress the immune system, enabling their survival during different stages of the anti-tumor immune response. This phenomenon, where tumor cells exhibit the described characteristics, is termed ‘immune escape’ [[1](/articles/s41420-024-01815-9#ref-CR1 \"Vinay DS, Ryan EP, Pawelec G, Talib WH, Stagg J, Elkord E, et al.

      "Today, adoptive cell therapy has many successes in cancer therapy, and this subject is brilliant in using chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The CAR T cell therapy, with its FDA-approved drugs, could treat several types of hematological malignancies and thus be very attractive for treating solid cancer. Unfortunately, the CAR T cell cannot be very functional in solid cancers due to its unique features. This treatment method has several harmful adverse effects that limit their applications, so novel treatments must use new cells like NK cells, NKT cells, and macrophage cells. Among these cells, the CAR macrophage cells, due to their brilliant innate features, are more attractive for solid tumor therapy and seem to be a better candidate for the prior treatment methods. The CAR macrophage cells have vital roles in the tumor microenvironment and, with their direct effect, can eliminate tumor cells efficiently. In addition, the CAR macrophage cells, due to being a part of the innate immune system, attended the tumor sites. With the high infiltration, their therapy modulations are more effective. This review investigates the last achievements in CAR-macrophage cells and the future of this immunotherapy treatment method.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Immunotherapy has come to fruition in recent years for cancer treatment by manipulating the immune system. Among the various forms of immunotherapy, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a brilliant and efficient way due to the tread more personalized and targeted treatments [[1](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR1 \"Tahmasebi S, Elahi R, Esmaeilzadeh A. Solid Tumors challenges and new insights of CAR T cell engineering. Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2019;15(5):619–36.\")]. As a subset of ACT, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are frontier with distinctive outcomes in cancer therapy. Until now introduced, six FDA-approved drugs utilizing CAR T against hematological malignancies were introduced: Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus, Breyanzi, Abecma, and Carvykti [[2](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR2 \"Asmamaw Dejenie T, Tiruneh GMM, Dessie Terefe G, Tadele Admasu F, Wale Tesega W, Chekol AE. Current updates on generations, approvals, and clinical trials of CAR T-cell therapy. Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2022;18(6):2114254.\")].\n",
      "\n",
      "However, CAR-T cell therapy has several obstacles the high cost and time-consuming production, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), “on-target/off-tumor” toxicity, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) [[3](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR3 \"Bonifant CL, Jackson HJ, Brentjens RJ, Curran KJ.

CAR T cell therapy: newer approaches to counter resistance and cost. Heliyon. 2020;6(4):e03779.\")]. Indeed, the CAR T cell had less effectiveness in solid cancers due to special features like heterogeneity, antigen escaping, limited T cell fitness, inefficient homing and infiltration, and high complexity of tumor microenvironment (TME) [[5](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR5 \"Wagner J, Wickman E, DeRenzo C, Gottschalk S. CAR T Cell Therapy for solid tumors: bright future or dark reality? Molecular Therapy: J American Soc Gene Therapy. 2020;28(11):2320–39.\")]. TME has a crucial role in cancer progression and reduces the efficacy of the CAR T cells by several mechanisms such as physical barriers, rivalry for metabolic fuels, cell exhaustion, immunosuppressive microenvironment, and various immunosuppressive cells like T regulatory (Treg) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [[6](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR6 \"Kankeu Fonkoua LA, Sirpilla O, Sakemura R, Siegler EL, Kenderian SS.

      "Genetic redirection of T lymphocytes with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has soared from treating cancers preclinically to FDA approval for hematologic malignancies and commercial-grade production scale in under 30 years. To date, solid tumors are less susceptible to CAR therapies and instead have been treated more successfully with immune checkpoint blockade or tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy. Here, we discuss the current challenges in treating solid tumors with CAR T cells, and the obstacles within the host and tumor microenvironment hindering their efficacy. We present a novel three-pronged approach for enhancing the efficacy of CAR T cells whereby a single infusion product can synergize the power of an optimal CAR construct, a highly potent T cell subset, and rejuvenate the endogenous immune response to conquer therapeutically-resistant solid tumors.\n",

      "The interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells enable high fidelity host protection against foreign pathogens and malignant cells. T cells have unparalleled ability to not only respond to these antigens but also to formulate memory, permitting a rapid and robust response upon future challenge against the same antigen. In terms of cancer, this potentially means long-term protection against recurrence of tumor cells expressing those antigens. Tumors can express antigens that are rapidly recognized by T cells, where mutations of self-antigens or germline cancer antigens differ sufficiently from normal antigens, or those that are less robustly detected, such as overexpressed self-antigens or differentiation antigens expressed by tissue from which the tumor originates ([1](#B1)). As a result, tumors that are more similar to normal cells, or those with highly immune-suppressive qualities, escape surveillance, permitting their outgrowth and potential to cause great harm. Many technological advances have created opportunities for cancer immunotherapists to bolster the power of T cells against cancer through reeducation and intelligent design to overcome the evasive barriers established by solid tumors. Perhaps immunotherapy represents one such opportunity posited by Hippocrates—a chance for intervention that could heal cancer patients much more effectively than time itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) comprises one of two arms of immunotherapy and involves *ex vivo* enrichment of tumor-specific cells, expansion to large numbers, and reinfusion into the patient to specifically target and kill cancer cells. ACT is conducted *via* two approaches: (1) naturally arising T cells that infiltrate the tumor—called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)—can be expanded *ex vivo* from the malignant site or (2) non-therapeutic endogenous lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood can be rendered tumor specific *via* genetic redirection with a T-cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The second arm of immunotherapy includes immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), where enhancing priming or rejuvenating exhausted T cells can render a functional, albeit often transient, antitumor state. This review will focus on CAR T cell therapies and how future CARs may work synergistically with other immunotherapies to drive long-lasting cures in patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CAR combines a single chain variable fragment (scFv) ectodomain that can target an antigen of choice with an endodomain comprised of the CD3ζ TCR signal and additional costimulatory domain. Its first use by Kuwana et al. and Gross et al. in the late 1980s revealed that redirection of a T cell with this receptor could induce antigen recognition without the major histocompatibility complex ([2](#B2), [3](#B3)). CAR-redirected T cell therapies have been successful in hematologic malignancies but are less effective... [content truncated]\n",
