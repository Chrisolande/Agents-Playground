This proof-of-concept study presents the development and validation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to automatically detect and classify endometrial polyps. <b>Methods</b>: A multicenter dataset (n = 3) comprising 65 hysteroscopies was used, yielding 33,239 frames and 37,512 annotated objects. Still frames were extracted from full-length videos and annotated for the presence of histologically confirmed polyps. A YOLOv1-based object detection model was used with a 70-20-10 split for training, validation, and testing. Primary performance metrics included recall, precision, and mean average precision'"

       "A computational approach by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital scientists promises to make designing T cell-based immunotherapies that target two cancer-related antigens at the same time far easier and faster. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a type of immunotherapy that reprograms a patient’s immune cells to target a tumor-specific protein antigen. Targeting just one cell surface antigen often is not enough to eradicate the tumor. Thus, scientists have tried to create CARs that target two proteins at once. However, they have encountered problems, including poor CAR expression on the surface of T cells and suboptimal cancer-killing ability. To address this, St. Jude researchers developed a computational method to screen many theoretical tandem CAR designs and ranked the top candidates for further optimization and validation. The researchers experimentally generated and validated the top-ranked tandem CAR candidates against their chosen targets, demonstrating that the computationally optimized CARs overcame the prior challenges and function better in treating animal models of cancer. The findings were published today in *Molecular Therapy*.\n",

       "“We have developed and validated a computational tool that can significantly accelerate the design of tandem CAR constructs with improved surface expression and anti-tumor function,” said co-corresponding author [Giedre Krenciute](https://www.stjude.org/research/labs/krenciute-lab.html), PhD, St. Jude [Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/bone-marrow-transplantation-cellular-therapy.html).\n",
       "\n",
       "While CAR T cells have successfully treated some blood cancers, they have not been as effective in treating solid and brain tumors. One reason is that cancer cells do not uniformly express the same proteins, so CAR T cells targeting a single antigen can miss malignant cells that do not express that protein, leaving them to regrow the tumor and cause a difficult-to-treat relapse. A tandem bi-specific CAR that targets two cancer-related proteins may prevent the original tumor from escaping the treatment, though optimizing their design has been a time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive challenge in the field.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Systematic experimental dissection allowed us to first pinpoint the region within the tandem CAR that was problematic for expression and function,” said co-corresponding author [M.

       "The computational pipeline predicted a better design for a tandem CAR that targeted the pediatric-brain tumor-related proteins B7-H3 and IL-13Rα2. The original unoptimized version of the bi-specific tandem CAR failed to reach the surface of the T cell, preventing it from contacting its target protein on tumor cells to perform its cancer-killing function. After confirming that the computationally optimized CAR expressed on the T cell surface, the researchers tested it against several single-targeted CARs in mice with tumors that had a mix of cells with both targets, one target or the other, or neither target, mimicking heterogeneous tumors observed in the clinic.\n",

       "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage therapy represents a promising new frontier in cancer immunotherapy, with the potential to overcome the limitations of CAR-T cell approaches, particularly in solid tumours. This comprehensive review focuses on the current state and future prospects of CAR macrophage technology, emphasising its applications in solid malignancies across preclinical and early clinical development. The key topics covered included CAR design optimisation, macrophage sources and engineering strategies, mechanisms of antitumour activity, *in vivo* efficacy in animal models, initial clinical trial results, and challenges for broader implementation. The unique properties of macrophages, including tumour penetration and microenvironment modulation, offer significant advantages over T cell-based therapies in solid-tumour settings. However, strategies to enhance persistence, maintain proinflammatory phenotypes, and improve manufacturing are required. Although early research suggests additional applications beyond oncology, including for infectious and inflammatory diseases, this review primarily concentrates on the oncologic potential of CAR-M therapies. Continued optimisation and larger randomised trials will be critical to establish clinical efficacy and define the role of this approach in the treatment of solid tumours.\n",

       "## 1 Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "Cellular immunotherapy strategies have gained momentum with the success of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy for the treatment of blood cancers ([1](#B1), [2](#B2)). However, these promising success stories reveal unavoidable challenges against solid tumours, which act as physical barriers against CAR-T cells ([3](#B3)–[8](#B8)). Although more than 200 clinical trials involving CAR-T cells have been registered to cure solid tumours, scientists have expanded the study sizes to cross tumour microenvironment (TME)-related hurdles and obtain a safe and stable way to combat tumour cells ([9](#B9), [10](#B10)). Limitations such as diminished antitumour efficacy due to the immunosuppressive TME, scarcity of appropriate tumour-associated antigens (TAAs), tumour-specific antigens (TSAs), dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that keeps CAR-T cells out of the tumour, and severe adverse effects have led scientists to renovate the CAR platform ([3](#B3), [11](#B11)). This unmet need has revolutionised CAR technology and has extended it to screen the innate immune compartment to manipulate other immune cells. Macrophages, after natural killer (NKs) cells, are being explored as alternative immune cells to upgrade this strategy ([5](#B5), [12](#B12)–[14](#B14)).\n",
       "\n",
       "In the mainstream CAR-T cells, the chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) platform is optimised in alignment with those of the CAR-T and CAR-NK platforms ([15](#B15), [16](#B16)). Macrophages, which are sentinels of the body, have emerged as promising options. They are specialised phagocytic cells of the innate immune system, being the first-line defense of the host by constantly removing dead cells and providing clearance of harmful pathogens. In addition to their wide range of functions, including antigen presentation, macrophages have plastic features and a generous biological gift to keep them in view as a live therapeutic candidate. Furthermore, macrophages are particularly active trafficking to the TME, constituting the largest immune cell population found in tumor... [content truncated]\n",

       "\n",
       "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy demonstrates substantial efficacy in various hematological malignancies. However, its application in solid tumors is still limited. Clinical studies report suboptimal outcomes such as reduced cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells and tumor evasion, underscoring the need to address the challenges of sliding cytotoxicity in CAR-T cells. Despite improvements from fourth and next-generation CAR-T cells, new challenges include systemic toxicity from continuously secreted proteins, low productivity, and elevated costs. Recent research targets genetic modifications to boost killing potential, metabolic interventions to hinder tumor progression, and diverse combination strategies to enhance CAR-T cell therapy. Efforts to reduce the duration and cost of CAR-T cell therapy include developing allogenic and in-vivo approaches, promising significant future advancements. Concurrently, innovative technologies and platforms enhance the potential of CAR-T cell therapy to overcome limitations in treating solid tumors. This review explores strategies to optimize CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, focusing on enhancing cytotoxicity and overcoming application restrictions. We summarize recent advances in T cell subset selection, CAR-T structural modifications, infiltration enhancement, genetic and metabolic interventions, production optimization, and the integration of novel technologies, presenting therapeutic approaches that could improve CAR-T cell therapy’s efficacy and applicability in solid tumors.\n",

       "**Summary:** In this work, we develop a simplified spatiotemporal model for CAR T-cell treatment of solid tumors, and use numerical simulations to compare the effect of introducing CAR T cells via intratumoral injection versus intracavitary administration in diverse cancer types. We demonstrate that the model can reproduce tumor and CAR T-cell data from small imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models. To account for spatial variation in cell concentration and provide insight into how the geometry of the delivery of CAR T cells impacts treatment efficacy, we employ a 3-D reaction-diffusion modeling framework for local administration of CAR T cells to treat solid tumors. In this article, we develop a 3-dimensional spatio-temporal model for CAR T-cell therapies applied to dynamic solid tumors.\n",

       "As the latest and most anticipated method of tumor immunotherapy, CAR-NK therapy has received increasing attention in recent years, and its safety and high efficiency have irreplaceable advantages over CAR-T. Current research focuses on the application of CAR-NK in hematological tumors, while there are fewer studies on solid tumor. This article reviews the process of constructing CAR-NK, the effects of hypoxia and metabolic factors, NK cell surface receptors, cytokines, and exosomes on the efficacy of CAR-NK in solid tumor, and the role of CAR-NK in various solid tumor. The mechanism of action and the research status of the potential of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor in clinical practice, and put forward the advantages, limitations and future problems of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor.\n",

       "## Open questions\n",
       "\n",
       "Due to the recent proposal of CAR-NK therapy, there are currently very few CAR end designs available for reference, especially for solid tumors. It is unclear whether there is a universal design that is effective for all solid tumors or whether there is a specific optimal solution design for each solid tumor. Moreover, the current experimental sample size is generally too small and lacks integration. We need a large number of basic and clinical trials to verify and compare the effects of various CARs. Further validation is needed to determine whether CAR-NK can be widely applied in the treatment of solid tumors in clinical practice in the future.\n",

       "Under normal circumstances, the immune system can identify and eliminate tumor cells within the Tumor microenvironment (TME). However, to survive and grow, tumor cells employ diverse strategies to suppress the immune system, enabling their survival during different stages of the anti-tumor immune response. This phenomenon, where tumor cells exhibit the described characteristics, is termed ‘immune escape’ [[1](/articles/s41420-024-01815-9#ref-CR1 \"Vinay DS, Ryan EP, Pawelec G, Talib WH, Stagg J, Elkord E, et al.

       "\n",
       "Today, adoptive cell therapy has many successes in cancer therapy, and this subject is brilliant in using chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The CAR T cell therapy, with its FDA-approved drugs, could treat several types of hematological malignancies and thus be very attractive for treating solid cancer. Unfortunately, the CAR T cell cannot be very functional in solid cancers due to its unique features. This treatment method has several harmful adverse effects that limit their applications, so novel treatments must use new cells like NK cells, NKT cells, and macrophage cells. Among these cells, the CAR macrophage cells, due to their brilliant innate features, are more attractive for solid tumor therapy and seem to be a better candidate for the prior treatment methods. The CAR macrophage cells have vital roles in the tumor microenvironment and, with their direct effect, can eliminate tumor cells efficiently. In addition, the CAR macrophage cells, due to being a part of the innate immune system, attended the tumor sites. With the high infiltration, their therapy modulations are more effective. This review investigates the last achievements in CAR-macrophage cells and the future of this immunotherapy treatment method.\n",

       "## Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "Immunotherapy has come to fruition in recent years for cancer treatment by manipulating the immune system. Among the various forms of immunotherapy, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a brilliant and efficient way due to the tread more personalized and targeted treatments [[1](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR1 \"Tahmasebi S, Elahi R, Esmaeilzadeh A. Solid Tumors challenges and new insights of CAR T cell engineering. Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2019;15(5):619–36.\")]. As a subset of ACT, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are frontier with distinctive outcomes in cancer therapy. Until now introduced, six FDA-approved drugs utilizing CAR T against hematological malignancies were introduced: Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus, Breyanzi, Abecma, and Carvykti [[2](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR2 \"Asmamaw Dejenie T, Tiruneh GMM, Dessie Terefe G, Tadele Admasu F, Wale Tesega W, Chekol AE. Current updates on generations, approvals, and clinical trials of CAR T-cell therapy. Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2022;18(6):2114254.\")].\n",
       "\n",
       "However, CAR-T cell therapy has several obstacles the high cost and time-consuming production, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), “on-target/off-tumor” toxicity, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) [[3](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR3 \"Bonifant CL, Jackson HJ, Brentjens RJ, Curran KJ. Toxicity and management in CAR T-cell therapy.

CAR T cell therapy: newer approaches to counter resistance and cost. Heliyon. 2020;6(4):e03779.\")]. Indeed, the CAR T cell had less effectiveness in solid cancers due to special features like heterogeneity, antigen escaping, limited T cell fitness, inefficient homing and infiltration, and high complexity of tumor microenvironment (TME) [[5](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR5 \"Wagner J, Wickman E, DeRenzo C, Gottschalk S. CAR T Cell Therapy for solid tumors: bright future or dark reality? Molecular Therapy: J American Soc Gene Therapy. 2020;28(11):2320–39.\")]. TME has a crucial role in cancer progression and reduces the efficacy of the CAR T cells by several mechanisms such as physical barriers, rivalry for metabolic fuels, cell exhaustion, immunosuppressive microenvironment, and various immunosuppressive cells like T regulatory (Treg) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [[6](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR6 \"Kankeu Fonkoua LA, Sirpilla O, Sakemura R, Siegler EL, Kenderian SS.
