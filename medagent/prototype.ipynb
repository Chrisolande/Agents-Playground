       "15 studies matched our eligibility criteria and were included in the study. The worldwide pooled prevalence of HIV among dialysis patients was 0.8% (95% CI 0.4 to 1.2) with a high degree of heterogeneity (95%) among the included studies. Substantial variations in pooled prevalence were found among different continents in our subgroup analysis. Africa (21.1%, 95% CI 6.4 to 35.8) and North America (19.3%, 95% CI 0.0 to 39.8) had a higher prevalence of HIV in dialysis patients whereas in Europe (0.3%, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6), South America (0.7%, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.6) and Asia (0.7%, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.6) the frequency was much lower. Perhaps, due to the lack of awareness and preventive knowledge, insufficient healthcare facilities and breaches in infection control protocols in dialysis centers, risky attitudes and practices immigration issues the prevalence of HIV among dialysis patients in Africa and North America enhanced as compared to that of Europe, Asia and South America. Strict adherence to HIV preventive practices, raising public awareness, and advanced healthcare systems are suggested to reduce the prevalence of HIV among dialysis patients all over the world.\n",

       "Article: Age and gender profiles of HIV infection burden and viraemia: novel metrics for HIV epidemic control in African populations with high antiretroviral therapy coverage.. To prioritize and tailor interventions for ending AIDS by 2030 in Africa, it is important to characterize the population groups in which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viraemia is concentrating. We analysed HIV testing and viral load data collected between 2013 and 2019 from the open, population-based Rakai Community Cohort Study in Uganda, to estimate HIV seroprevalence and population viral suppression over time by gender, 1-year age bands, and residence in inland and fishing communities. All estimates were standardized to the underlying source population by using census data.\n",

       "We then assessed 95-95-95 targets in their ability to identify the populations in which viraemia is concentrated. Following the implementation of Universal Test and Treat, the proportion of individuals with viraemia decreased from 4.9% (4.6%-5.3%) in 2013 to 1.9% (1.7%-2.2%) in 2019 in inland communities and from 19.1% (18.0%-20.4%) in 2013 to 4.7% (4.0%-5.5%) in 2019 in fishing communities. Viraemia did not concentrate in the age and gender groups furthest from achieving 95-95-95 targets. Instead, in both inland and fishing communities, women aged 25-29 years and men aged 30-34 years were the 5-year age groups that contributed most to population-level viraemia in 2019, despite these groups being close to or having already achieved 95-95-95 targets. The 95-95-95 targets provide a useful benchmark for monitoring progress towards HIV epidemic control, but do not contextualize underlying population structures and so may direct interventions towards groups that represent a marginal fraction of the population with viraemia.\n",

Most targeted depression, employing non-pharmacological approaches such as task-sharing and stepped-care models. Findings suggest integrated MH and HIV care improves MH symptoms and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Despite limited studies, evidence supports the feasibility and benefits of integrating MH services into HIV care in Africa.

       "Data were collected from two districts of Uganda and Zambia. In Uganda, the two selected districts were Arua, in the northern West Nile region, and Moroto, in the northeast Karamoja region. In Zambia, the study districts were Mongu, in the Western Province, and Chipata in the Eastern Province. Each study district held two PLWH focus groups (one male, another female) with 5-7 participants per group and 3-4 key informant interviews for a total of 55 participants. PLWH and healthcare providers were eligible if they were (1) aged 18 years or older and (2) an HIV-positive client receiving antiretroviral therapy services at the participating clinic or working in a health services capacity at the clinic. Cancer stigma drivers included widespread misconceptions about disease origins and outcomes, associations with other stigmatising conditions and behaviours such as HIV, TB, and substance use, limited treatment options that heightened fears of diagnosis and inadequate training of healthcare providers. Study participants noted that experiences of stigma led to reduced treatment-seeking behaviours among PLWH, increased social isolation, and poor cancer-related care practices within clinics. Recommended interventions to combat stigma included improved education for providers and patients, private counselling, and peer support. Results underscore the presence and impacts of stigma in the study population, emphasising the need for research informing culturally sensitive interventions that enhance educational outreach and promote engagement in care among targeted populations. This article is linked to an ongoing clinical trial registered on clinical trials.gov (clinical trial No: NCT05487807; Registration date: 27 November 2023) and relates to the pre-results stage.\n",

       "This was repeated using loop functions until we obtained all articles directly or indirectly linked to the original paper. Overall, we show an increasing trend of HIV cure-related observational and interventional studies globally; with the least number of studies in Africa. The PubMed query retrieved 7122 HIV cure-related published articles, as at 23 July 2024; of which 2820 were directly or indirectly linked to understanding the HIV reservoir. Of the 2916 articles with first author affiliation country determined, only 52 (0.02%) had affiliations from African institutions. Of the 1955 articles with last author affiliation country determined, only 43 (0.02%) had affiliations from institutions in Africa. The majority of articles with first or last authors from African institutes were descriptive clinical studies of HIV infection, with less than ten studies specifically addressing HIV latency. Scale up of HIV cure research in Africa remains critical to hasten achievement of the global goal of an end to the AIDS epidemic by 2030. There is a need to bridge the technical, infrastructural and technological divides and address constraints in funding and capacity; to promote discovery, characterization and application of promising innovative therapies including immunotherapies and cell and gene therapies towards attaining an effective, durable, affordable and scalable HIV cure.\n",

       "Over the rounds, coverage increased from zero to 80-86 % for NSP and zero to 10-20 % for OAT. The proportion of people living with HIV (PLHIV) that were virally suppressed increased from 7-14 % to 39-55 %. Accessing NSP and OAT was associated with reduced syringe sharing at last injection (NSP adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.31; 95 %CI:0.24-0.40; OAT aOR=0.046; 95 %CI:0.034-0.061) and OAT was associated with reduced injecting frequency (adjusted rate ratio=0.21; 95 %CI:0.12-0.36). Using OAT was associated with increased ART coverage (aOR=2.76; 95 %CI:1.50-5.06) and viral suppression (aOR=2.99; 95 %CI:1.78-5.03) among PLHIV, while NSP was not. HIV incidence decreased from 6.10 (95 %CI:3.56-9.77) to 1.49 (95 %CI:0.79-2.54) per 100 person-years between the first and second half of the study. Accessing NSP was associated with lower HIV incidence (adjusted hazard ratio=0.25; 95 %CI:0.087-0.58). This study provides strong evidence for the benefits of NSP and OAT on varied HIV outcomes among PWID in Africa.\n",

      "\n",
      "The development of bi-specific antibody treatments is an approach aimed at improving cancer immunotherapies, where many current treatment forms only target one tumor-specific antigen. This approach has yielded some success, but addressing a single tumor-specific protein antigen is often not enough to effectively kill all the tumor cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a highly effective treatment for multiple malignancies. However, one limitation is tumor antigen-heterogeneity and downregulation, which allows tumor cells to evade conventional, monospecific CAR T cells,” the researchers wrote.\n",

      "Targeting two or more cell surface antigens to address multiple drivers of cancer growth, bi-specific CAR T cells represent a logical next step in tackling tumor heterogeneity. But designing effective bi-specifics has been a challenge.\n",

      "In this study, the team initially designed a bi-specific tandem CAR targeting the IL13Rα2 and B7-H3 antigens, which are often present in pediatric brain tumors. Unfortunately, their original construct failed to express on the T cell surface. But this failure led to a breakthrough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We describe how our originally designed constructs failed to express due to a ‘trouble region’ within the VH (variable heavy) of the IL13Rα2  scFv (single-chain variable fragment),” the researchers wrote. Through systematic testing of 24 tandem constructs and super-resolution microscopy, the researchers found that misfolding and intracellular accumulation was the likely causes of this design’s expression failure.\n",

      "A computational approach by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital scientists promises to make designing T cell-based immunotherapies that target two cancer-related antigens at the same time far easier and faster. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a type of immunotherapy that reprograms a patient’s immune cells to target a tumor-specific protein antigen. Targeting just one cell surface antigen often is not enough to eradicate the tumor. Thus, scientists have tried to create CARs that target two proteins at once. However, they have encountered problems, including poor CAR expression on the surface of T cells and suboptimal cancer-killing ability. To address this, St. Jude researchers developed a computational method to screen many theoretical tandem CAR designs and ranked the top candidates for further optimization and validation. The researchers experimentally generated and validated the top-ranked tandem CAR candidates against their chosen targets, demonstrating that the computationally optimized CARs overcame the prior challenges and function better in treating animal models of cancer. The findings were published today in *Molecular Therapy*.\n",

      "\n",
      "While CAR T cells have successfully treated some blood cancers, they have not been as effective in treating solid and brain tumors. One reason is that cancer cells do not uniformly express the same proteins, so CAR T cells targeting a single antigen can miss malignant cells that do not express that protein, leaving them to regrow the tumor and cause a difficult-to-treat relapse. A tandem bi-specific CAR that targets two cancer-related proteins may prevent the original tumor from escaping the treatment, though optimizing their design has been a time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive challenge in the field.\n",

      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy demonstrates substantial efficacy in various hematological malignancies. However, its application in solid tumors is still limited. Clinical studies report suboptimal outcomes such as reduced cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells and tumor evasion, underscoring the need to address the challenges of sliding cytotoxicity in CAR-T cells. Despite improvements from fourth and next-generation CAR-T cells, new challenges include systemic toxicity from continuously secreted proteins, low productivity, and elevated costs. Recent research targets genetic modifications to boost killing potential, metabolic interventions to hinder tumor progression, and diverse combination strategies to enhance CAR-T cell therapy. Efforts to reduce the duration and cost of CAR-T cell therapy include developing allogenic and in-vivo approaches, promising significant future advancements. Concurrently, innovative technologies and platforms enhance the potential of CAR-T cell therapy to overcome limitations in treating solid tumors. This review explores strategies to optimize CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, focusing on enhancing cytotoxicity and overcoming application restrictions. We summarize recent advances in T cell subset selection, CAR-T structural modifications, infiltration enhancement, genetic and metabolic interventions, production optimization, and the integration of novel technologies, presenting therapeutic approaches that could improve CAR-T cell therapy’s efficacy and applicability in solid tumors.\n",

Nevertheless, the majority of patients, particularly those with solid tumors, continue to exhibit resistance to CAR-T cell therapy.

      "Most relevant content: In this work, we develop a simplified spatiotemporal model for CAR T-cell treatment of solid tumors, and use numerical simulations to compare the effect of introducing CAR T cells via intratumoral injection versus intracavitary administration in diverse cancer types. We demonstrate that the model can reproduce tumor and CAR T-cell data from small imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models. To account for spatial variation in cell concentration and provide insight into how the geometry of the delivery of CAR T cells impacts treatment efficacy, we employ a 3-D reaction-diffusion modeling framework for local administration of CAR T cells to treat solid tumors. In this article, we develop a 3-dimensional spatio-temporal model for CAR T-cell therapies applied to dynamic solid tumors.\n",

      "\n",
      "As the latest and most anticipated method of tumor immunotherapy, CAR-NK therapy has received increasing attention in recent years, and its safety and high efficiency have irreplaceable advantages over CAR-T. Current research focuses on the application of CAR-NK in hematological tumors, while there are fewer studies on solid tumor. This article reviews the process of constructing CAR-NK, the effects of hypoxia and metabolic factors, NK cell surface receptors, cytokines, and exosomes on the efficacy of CAR-NK in solid tumor, and the role of CAR-NK in various solid tumor. The mechanism of action and the research status of the potential of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor in clinical practice, and put forward the advantages, limitations and future problems of CAR-NK in the treatment of solid tumor.\n",

      "* This article provides a detailed introduction to the factors that currently constrain the efficacy of CAR-NK in solid tumors, providing reference for the development and design of CAR-NK in the future.\n",
      "* At present, most of the experiments are about the effect of CAR-NK on hematological tumors. This article focuses on the latest feasibility of CAR-NK therapy in different solid tumors. Provide theoretical basis for expanding the applicability of CAR-NK therapy.\n",
      "* The author collected ongoing clinical trials of CAR-NK applied to solid tumors, providing ideas for subsequent clinical trial initiators and avoiding duplicate work. At the same time, the latest developments in these experiments can also be monitored.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Open questions\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the recent proposal of CAR-NK therapy, there are currently very few CAR end designs available for reference, especially for solid tumors. It is unclear whether there is a universal design that is effective for all solid tumors or whether there is a specific optimal solution design for each solid tumor. Moreover, the current experimental sample size is generally too small and lacks integration. We need a large number of basic and clinical trials to verify and compare the effects of various CARs. Further validation is needed to determine whether CAR-NK can be widely applied in the treatment of solid tumors in clinical practice in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Under normal circumstances, the immune system can identify and eliminate tumor cells within the Tumor microenvironment (TME). However, to survive and grow, tumor cells employ diverse strategies to suppress the immune system, enabling their survival during different stages of the anti-tumor immune response. This phenomenon, where tumor cells exhibit the described characteristics, is termed ‘immune escape’ [[1](/articles/s41420-024-01815-9#ref-CR1 \"Vinay DS, Ryan EP, Pawelec G, Talib WH, Stagg J, Elkord E, et al.

      "## Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, adoptive cell therapy has many successes in cancer therapy, and this subject is brilliant in using chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The CAR T cell therapy, with its FDA-approved drugs, could treat several types of hematological malignancies and thus be very attractive for treating solid cancer. Unfortunately, the CAR T cell cannot be very functional in solid cancers due to its unique features. This treatment method has several harmful adverse effects that limit their applications, so novel treatments must use new cells like NK cells, NKT cells, and macrophage cells. Among these cells, the CAR macrophage cells, due to their brilliant innate features, are more attractive for solid tumor therapy and seem to be a better candidate for the prior treatment methods. The CAR macrophage cells have vital roles in the tumor microenvironment and, with their direct effect, can eliminate tumor cells efficiently. In addition, the CAR macrophage cells, due to being a part of the innate immune system, attended the tumor sites. With the high infiltration, their therapy modulations are more effective. This review investigates the last achievements in CAR-macrophage cells and the future of this immunotherapy treatment method.\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Immunotherapy has come to fruition in recent years for cancer treatment by manipulating the immune system. Among the various forms of immunotherapy, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a brilliant and efficient way due to the tread more personalized and targeted treatments [[1](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR1 \"Tahmasebi S, Elahi R, Esmaeilzadeh A. Solid Tumors challenges and new insights of CAR T cell engineering. Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2019;15(5):619–36.\")]. As a subset of ACT, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are frontier with distinctive outcomes in cancer therapy. Until now introduced, six FDA-approved drugs utilizing CAR T against hematological malignancies were introduced: Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus, Breyanzi, Abecma, and Carvykti [[2](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR2 \"Asmamaw Dejenie T, Tiruneh GMM, Dessie Terefe G, Tadele Admasu F, Wale Tesega W, Chekol AE.

      "\n",
      "However, CAR-T cell therapy has several obstacles the high cost and time-consuming production, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), “on-target/off-tumor” toxicity, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) [[3](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR3 \"Bonifant CL, Jackson HJ, Brentjens RJ, Curran KJ.

CAR T cell therapy: newer approaches to counter resistance and cost. Heliyon. 2020;6(4):e03779.\")]. Indeed, the CAR T cell had less effectiveness in solid cancers due to special features like heterogeneity, antigen escaping, limited T cell fitness, inefficient homing and infiltration, and high complexity of tumor microenvironment (TME) [[5](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR5 \"Wagner J, Wickman E, DeRenzo C, Gottschalk S. CAR T Cell Therapy for solid tumors: bright future or dark reality? Molecular Therapy: J American Soc Gene Therapy. 2020;28(11):2320–39.\")]. TME has a crucial role in cancer progression and reduces the efficacy of the CAR T cells by several mechanisms such as physical barriers, rivalry for metabolic fuels, cell exhaustion, immunosuppressive microenvironment, and various immunosuppressive cells like T regulatory (Treg) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [[6](/articles/10.1186/s40364-023-00537-x#ref-CR6 \"Kankeu Fonkoua LA, Sirpilla O, Sakemura R, Siegler EL, Kenderian SS.

      "Genetic redirection of T lymphocytes with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has soared from treating cancers preclinically to FDA approval for hematologic malignancies and commercial-grade production scale in under 30 years. To date, solid tumors are less susceptible to CAR therapies and instead have been treated more successfully with immune checkpoint blockade or tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy. Here, we discuss the current challenges in treating solid tumors with CAR T cells, and the obstacles within the host and tumor microenvironment hindering their efficacy. We present a novel three-pronged approach for enhancing the efficacy of CAR T cells whereby a single infusion product can synergize the power of an optimal CAR construct, a highly potent T cell subset, and rejuvenate the endogenous immune response to conquer therapeutically-resistant solid tumors.\n",

      "\n",
      "The interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells enable high fidelity host protection against foreign pathogens and malignant cells. T cells have unparalleled ability to not only respond to these antigens but also to formulate memory, permitting a rapid and robust response upon future challenge against the same antigen. In terms of cancer, this potentially means long-term protection against recurrence of tumor cells expressing those antigens. Tumors can express antigens that are rapidly recognized by T cells, where mutations of self-antigens or germline cancer antigens differ sufficiently from normal antigens, or those that are less robustly detected, such as overexpressed self-antigens or differentiation antigens expressed by tissue from which the tumor originates ([1](#B1)). As a result, tumors that are more similar to normal cells, or those with highly immune-suppressive qualities, escape surveillance, permitting their outgrowth and potential to cause great harm. Many technological advances have created opportunities for cancer immunotherapists to bolster the power of T cells against cancer through reeducation and intelligent design to overcome the evasive barriers established by solid tumors. Perhaps immunotherapy represents one such opportunity posited by Hippocrates—a chance for intervention that could heal cancer patients much more effectively than time itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) comprises one of two arms of immunotherapy and involves *ex vivo* enrichment of tumor-specific cells, expansion to large numbers, and reinfusion into the patient to specifically target and kill cancer cells. ACT is conducted *via* two approaches: (1) naturally arising T cells that infiltrate the tumor—called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)—can be expanded *ex vivo* from the malignant site or (2) non-therapeutic endogenous lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood can be rendered tumor specific *via* genetic redirection with a T-cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The second arm of immunotherapy includes immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), where enhancing priming or rejuvenating exhausted T cells can render a functional, albeit often transient, antitumor state. This review will focus on CAR T cell therapies and how future CARs may work synergistically with other immunotherapies to drive long-lasting cures in patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CAR combines a single chain variable fragment (scFv) ectodomain that can target an antigen of choice with an endodomain comprised of the CD3ζ TCR signal and additional costimulatory domain. Its first use by Kuwana et al. and Gross et al. in the late 1980s revealed that redirection of a T cell with this receptor could induce antigen recognition without the major histocompatibility complex ([2](#B2), [3](#B3)). CAR-redirected T cell therapies have been successful in hematologic malignancies but are less effective... [content truncated]\n",
